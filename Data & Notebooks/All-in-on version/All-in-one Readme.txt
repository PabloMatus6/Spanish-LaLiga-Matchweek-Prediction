ALL-IN-ONE VERSION

An 'All-in-one' version of the project is added, in which all notebooks are collected into one. 
To run this version you don't need to download any previous file, you just need to run the whole notebook, from start to finish.
This version solves the problem of the 2015-16 season with the API by removing this season from the request. 
The results are different from the original project, and this version lacks comments and conclusions about the results obtained. 
The only purpose of adding this version to the repository is to facilitate the replicability of the project. 
Thanks to this notebook it is possible to appreciate the changes to be made with respect to the original version if the interval of seasons to be used is different.
