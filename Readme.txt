INTRODUCTION TO THE PROJECT

Here is contained the final project of the Master in Data Science at KSCHOOL, done by Pablo Fern√°ndez Matus. The name of this project is "Spanish La Liga Predictions" and it is realised during the first half of year 2021.
During this project work will be carried out with data related to soccer matches results, from which will be extracted relevant information in order to build a prediction model. The type of model, and what it will consist on are decissions that would be made as the content of the data being worked on becomes better understood.
The project is divided into different notebooks following the steps taken for the data processing, algorithm execution and data analysis. 
This final step is performed via Tableau dashboards operating as the front-end of the project.
All the notebooks that make up this project can be found in this repository, including the Tableau file that contains the Front-end.
In terms of software or licences required to run this program, it is sufficient to have access to Jupyter Notebook for the code. To view the front-end in Tableau, you will need a Tableau account or request the free trial offered by Tableau desktop. 


USER'S MANUAL

If the project is downloaded from github, it is recommended to save all notebooks in the same folder in the local directory. It will also be necessary that the CSV files to be downloaded during the execution of the project are saved in the same folder. This will facilitate the execution of the code.
When this project was carried out, the requests made to the API contained match information and statistics for the seasons between 2015-16 and 2020-21. 
However, when this project was being completed, the API removed the data from the 2015-2016 season, so the process of requesting data from the API cannot be done in the same way as it was done at the beginning of this project. However, it is reflected how these requests were made in notebooks 01 and 02. What was done in these notebooks is replaced by a CSV data file that is indicated how to download at the beginning of notebook 03, but it is important that this file is stored locally in the same folder in which the notebook is saved. It has been decided to keep these notebooks because they are very useful to understand where the data comes from and the meaning of most of them. However, if you want to replicate this project, these notebooks should not be executed, but you should start directly from notebook 03. 
On the other hand, if this project is being carried out years later or you simply want to execute it with a different range of seasons, the code of notebooks 01 and 02 is perfectly valid, you will have to change in the requests and in the for loops the range of seasons that you want to request. 
The season request to change is the variable 'year'. However, despite having this name, it does not symbolise a calendar year but a season, specifically, the year represents the second part of the season to which it refers. This other way, if this variable has as value the year 2016 the two in it correspond to the season 2015-16, in the same way it will work for other seasons.
It is important to know that this API only allows to make requests referring to the last 5 seasons from the moment the request is made, therefore, if this request is made years later, the API request must be adjusted accordingly. To specify the changes that would have to be made if the project is to be replicated with other seasons, this change must be made in all the code cells that contain information relating to the year variable in notebooks 01 and zero two, and it will also be necessary to make this change in the plots that refer to or filter data according to these variables in notebook 04, although in this case it would only be to be able to display the data correctly, not for the correct execution of the code.
As already mentioned, in the case of wanting to replicate this project, the recommendation is to read notebooks 01 and 02 without executing them and start executing the code from notebook 03.
Once you have chosen one of the two possible ways to replicate the project, you should know that the notebooks are not independent, each notebook starts from the last point of the previous one, so it is important to start in order and run the notebooks 1 by 1. As you run these notebooks, CSV files will be saved in the local folder in which the notebook is saved, so you will not have to make any changes to the code, and you can run them all perfectly without any error. 
The github repository also contains a folder, which contains two Tableau files. 1 of them is a front end of this project and the second one is a small visualisation of the prediction model and its final results corresponding to the end of this project. To run these files, it is not necessary to have the data as they are stored in the file itself.
In this document we will try to explain as well as possible the content of the data and the process they have gone through throughout the project, however, in case you want to know more information about the content of the data or have any doubts about it, you can refer to the API documentation.


ALL-IN-ONE VERSION

An 'All-in-one' version of the project is added, in which all ntoebooks are collected into one. 
To run this version you don't need to download any previous file, you just need to run the whole notebook, from start to finish.
This version solves the problem of the 2015-16 season with the API by removing this season from the request. The results are different from the original project, and this version lacks comments and conclusions about the results obtained. The only purpose of adding this version to the repository is to facilitate the replicability of the project. Thanks to this notebook it is possible to appreciate the changes to be made with respect to the original version if the interval of seasons to be used is different.
