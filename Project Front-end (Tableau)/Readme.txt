It is a front-end, so once you have downloaded the files you only need to view them in presentation mode and interact with the different sheets. 

In the front-end file of the project you will find sheets, and dashboards included in stories. All of them were created with the data used by the model to make its predictions.

The file containing the results of the predictions of the model used in the project explains these predictions, as well as the conclusions drawn from them.

In case there is a problem with the data when reproducing the file, use the google drive link that can be found in the project report and in the Readme of the whole project, there, you will be able to download the data contained in files .xls. In this case, it will be necessary to save this data in the same folder than the Tableau files.
